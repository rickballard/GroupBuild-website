# Value Proposition & Audiences
## Core Promise
**Organize and build together, safely and effectively.** GroupBuild enables aligned communities to go from idea → brief → contribution → validation → action, **without doxing** and **with reputation-weighted signal** that cuts noise.

## Who It’s For
- **Organizers / Movement Leads:** publish briefs, form cohorts, schedule actions, access safety kits.
- **Contributors (devs, designers, ops, “vibecoders”):** ship PRs from AI-assisted briefs, earn rep.
- **Supporters / Attendees:** join cohorts, RSVP to events, learn best practices, donate.

## Differentiators
- **Pseudonymous-first:** safety without paralysis; no forced KYC.
- **Weighted signal:** reputation surfaces quality, reduces brigading.
- **Action loop:** events, prompts, resources → real-world execution.
- **Mixed workflows:** AI briefs + human PRs, fast demo links, ScriptTags to automate glue.
