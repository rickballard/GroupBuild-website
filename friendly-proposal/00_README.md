# GroupBuild — Website Overhaul "Friendly Proposal"
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-15 01:34:28

This package proposes a pragmatic information architecture, content plan, MVP→V2→V3 product framing, and a concrete GitHub Pages structure for **GroupBuild.org**. It is designed to inspire the **Profile & GitHub Sites** session to modernize the public site while keeping scope tight for the app team.

**Guiding constraints** (from Rick):
- Pseudonymous, never-doxed users; lightweight human/bot gate via questionnaire/survey.
- Reputation/RepTags shown on content; ScriptTags on posts (for automation/workflows).
- MVP must include **Resources** for real-world organizing (e.g., safety tents, protest checklists).
- Avoid scope creep into anti-censorship DB (belongs to CoCivium/CoModules).
- V3 ideas like multi-path signal propagation/connectivity assurance noted as speculative.
- Free to all; donations via slider (à la YouTube style).

**Target outcomes:**
- Clear value prop for organizers & contributors.
- Fast path to “see a demo” (sandbox forum/chat separate from marketing front-page).
- Credibility via resources, case-style tutorials, and transparent roadmap.
- Repo-first content model (this repo is the site’s CMS).
