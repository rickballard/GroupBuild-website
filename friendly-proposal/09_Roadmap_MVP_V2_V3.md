# Roadmap — MVP → V2 → V3
## MVP (90-day strike team)
- Pseudonymous accounts + simple RepTags (earned via merged PRs/reviews/attendance attestations).
- Weighted voting on briefs/issues.
- AI brief generator (server-side prompt templates) + PR templates.
- Demo Sandbox: lightweight forum/chat with ScriptTags on posts.
- Resources library (safety, checklists, templates).
- Events: minimal scheduler + cohort invites + reminders.
- Donations: slider UI (placeholder) + transparent ledger page.

## V2
- Reputation v2 (topic-scoped, brigading resistance, attestations).
- Conversation trails + auto-summaries that feed briefs.
- Cohort analytics (conversion, retention), GTM ops.
- Bridges: Discord/Matrix webhooks; mobile PWA.
- Resilient hosting playbook + mirror button.

## V3 (speculative / R&D)
- Multi-path signal propagation & connectivity assurance during events (hardware dongles/mesh/LoRa/etc.).
- Optional on-chain attestations for event proofs.
- Advanced simulation/safety modeling for mass events.
*(V3 explicitly exploratory; not a delivery commitment.)*
